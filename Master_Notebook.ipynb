DisPerSE can be downloaded from the aforementioned DisPerSE website or from the github (https://github.com/thierry-sousbie/DisPerSE). There are two required libraries/programs to be able to use the most basic functions of DisPerSE. They are CMake and GSL. You will also want CGAL which is used for the delaunay_2D/3D functions that output files in a format (.NDnet) that can be fed into other functions. \n",

Then installing should be as simple as running \"make install\". You should then be able to find several executables in the \"disperse/bin\" folder, the most important ones are mse, delaunay_2D, delaunay_3D, and skelconv as these are the ones I used. There are also other functions, however, many of these are not essential."

    "The input DisPerSE takes in needs the coordinates of galaxies in the form of either RA, DEC, and Z or SGX, SGY, and SGZ. The easiest way to do this is to read out the contents of a catalog into an ascii text file, which is one of the file formats DisPerSE can read. You also need to name each column a specific keyword in the heading so that DisPerSE will recognize what that column's data represents. I will show an example of what I did below, but further examples of what this ascii file should look like can be found on https://www2.iap.fr/users/sousbie/web/html/index744c.html?post/survey_ascii-format."

The difference between the 3D and 2D versions is simply whether you include three position coordinates or two in your input file; DisPerSE should let you know if there are not enough arguments in the input to use them. To use either version, just run \"<path>/disperse/bin/delaunay_nD filename\". After running for a bit, delaunay_nD should generate a new file called \"filename.NDnet\"."
